# Course Project

## Outline

The goal of the class project is for you to start reading the primary literature, and to get some practice in writing and speaking. The final product will be a science proposal and a short 15 minute talk to the class describing your proposal. In order to stay on track I've set the following milestones for you to meet.

At each step you turn something in on Brightspace and talk to me about it, either via email or in person.

### The project

The final project is to submit a research proposal based on the results of a recent journal article. It is very rare for a piece of science to not leave unanswered questions. Your project is to understand a paper, discern the questions that it leaves unanswered, or could use further work, and to write a proposal that tackles some aspect of that further work.

The science carried out in the proposal should be relatively detailed. You will need to decide on your approach, be it a field program, numerical modelling, or laboratory work. Your proposal should be practical, which will mean demonstrating some grasp of the limitations of the approaches. By "practical", I mean consuming less than $1 million dollars of resources. (It doesn't require any ingenuity to come up with a sampling plan requiring 30 ships, or a simulation requiring use of 20,000 computer nodes for a year).

### Example proposal

My colleagues at Scripps and UW have been kind enough to share a proposal they wrote based on modelling results from a GRL paper. This was a major proposal to the US National Science Foundation for almost $3M. Of course it underwent very critical peer review, and was written by two of the brightest oceanographers in the field. So, it is much more polished than what I would expect from you (or even myself!). However, it gives a good idea of what is involved.

### Late policy for milestones and project

As for the rest of the course, 10% per day including weekends.  If you require an academic concession please contact the instructor.

## Milestones

### Choose a "recent" paper

The first task it to choose a recent short paper in physical oceanography from *Science*, *Nature*, or *Geophysical Research Letters*. All three are available in the library and online from UVic.

- [A list of possible papers](./ProjectPossiblePapers) somewhat dated!
- [Nature "Physical Oceanography" papers](https://www.nature.com/subjects/physical-oceanography/nature) - though be judicious with these.  Some of them are things like cryosphere etc, which are outside our direct interests here.  Ask if in doubt.
- [Nature Geosciences "Physical Oceanography" papers](https://www.nature.com/subjects/physical-oceanography/ngeo)
- [Science Magazine possible search link](https://www.science.org/action/doSearch?field1=AllField&text1=Physical+oceanography&field2=AllField&text2=&publication%5B%5D=science&publication%5B%5D=science&publication=&Ppub=&AfterMonth=&AfterYear=2010&BeforeMonth=&BeforeYear=2023) - be sure to look at "Reports" and "Articles" in particular.


This list is by no-means exhaustive. If you have a paper that you think appropriate please check with me (sooner rather than later).

Please let me know as soon as you have chosen a paper. I will not allow multiple folks to do the same paper, so first-come, first-served. There is (will be) a list of papers chosen by folks here.
